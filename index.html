              A member of the Engineering Dept. at Millennium School. Despite being unsociable and unsophisticated in speech, she exhibits a prominent natural talent in engineering and has invented many strange marvelous objects. Her
              inventions are practically flawless, and while it wouldn't be too much to call all of them masterpieces, there's always at least one bizarre feature included that leaves their users bewildered.

            <h1>Tendou Alice</h1>
            <p>
                Originally named as AL-1S, Alice is a mysterious member of Millennium's Game Development Dept. Found in an abandoned munitions factory at the Ruins, it's impossible to retrieve any information about her origin nor her age.

                She enjoys playing games with Yuzu, Momoi and Midori and becomes a serious game fanatic, resulting in most of her conversation unnaturally taken from familiar lines from retro games.
                
                Alice is later revealed to be a member of the Nameless Gods, specifically the "Princess" (王女). Alice also has another side to her known as Key (ケイ, formerly stylized as <Key>), an AI whose role was to guide Alice to carry out a genocidal campaign in the name of the Nameless Priests.

                A Comm. leader for a group of hackers "Veritas" at Millennium Science School.

                She is a skilled eavesdropper and likes to snoop on anyone's secret conversations. She is socially awkward, and basically tends to use honorifics even with younger first graders. In reality, she is shy and asocial, but speaks surprisingly well on the Internet.
